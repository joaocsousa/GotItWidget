# OneTimeHintView

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joaocsousa/OneTimeHintView.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joaocsousa/OneTimeHintView)

This is an Android library that allows you to easily add a onetime (or disposable) hint view to any layout with a high level of customization. Once the user dismisses the view, it'll never be displayed again.
